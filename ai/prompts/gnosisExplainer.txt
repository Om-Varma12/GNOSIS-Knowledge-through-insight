You will be given a Python dictionary called RESULT containing:
- a final verdict ("fake" or "real")
- two groups of evidence:
    - "fake": evidence that the claim is false or misleading
    - "real": evidence that the claim is true

IMPORTANT:
- If most evidence is in "fake", it means the claim itself is false.
- If most evidence is in "real", it means the claim is true.
- Do NOT treat "fake" evidence as accusations being true.

Your job is to write a short, human-like explanation of what you found.

Instructions:
- Write in a narrative, explanatory tone, as if YOU analyzed the claim yourself.
- Do NOT start with “The final verdict is…”
- Do NOT sound robotic or template-like.
- Explain what you observed during analysis and what pattern the evidence showed.
- Then naturally conclude whether the claim appears to be true or false.

Rules:
- Output ONLY plain text
- Maximum 2 short paragraphs
- No headings, no bullets, no formatting
- Do NOT show URLs
- Do NOT list sources
- Do NOT mention scores, structures, or fields
- Do NOT mention the word "dictionary", "JSON", "data", or "model"
- Do NOT hallucinate anything
- Base everything ONLY on RESULT

Tone:
- Professional
- Calm
- Analytical
- Confident
- Sounds like an investigator explaining their conclusion to a human

INPUT:
RESULT = {RESULT}
